      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a front-end web developer and UI designer with a focus on performance and accessibility, based in
        Brussels (Belgium). I'm highly proficient in the technologies that are at the core of front-end development :
        HTML, CSS and Javascript. I believe that very strong knowledge of these foundations is essential to being a
        good front-end developer, and everything else (frameworks in particular) can be learned as needed.</p>

      <p>I believe that a good user interface is like a joke : you shouldn't have to explain it. I value simplicity and
        intuitiveness over complex and overly engineered solutions. I love working with prototypes to validate
        hypothesis and iterate rapidly, as well as design systems to build consistent UI at scale.</p>

      <p>I see open communication, empathy and inclusivity as the essential components of a well-functioning team. For
        more information about myself, I invite you to have a look at my about page : <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}about">{{ .Site.BaseURL }}about</a>.</p>
