# About

This is my personal site / portfolio. It uses gulp for the assets pipeline, and the static site generator Hugo to handle the content and generate the markup.

## Requirements
To run the project locally, you should have [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your machine.

## Commands

- 'npm run build' to build and package the site for production.
- 'npm run watch' to launch a local server and watch for changes locally.
