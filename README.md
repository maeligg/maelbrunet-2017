#About
This is my personal site / portfolio. It uses gulp for the assets pipeline, and the static site generator Hugo to handle the content and generate the markup.

#Workflow
The npm 'build' script is used for deployment on production only. To run the site locally, you need to run simultaneously two commands (in separate shells) : 'gulp' in the root directory and 'hugo server' from inside the site/ directory.
